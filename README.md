# ðŸ“ž Call Center Data Analysis Project

#  Objective

This project aims to analyze a month's worth of call center data in order to identify service performance, customer satisfaction trends, and operational bottlenecks. The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to enhance customer experience, reduce dissatisfaction, and improve service level efficiency.

 # Tools Used: 
Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, processing, analysis, and dashboard creation.

# Project Steps

# 1. Data Cleaning & Processing

Converted date/time columns to proper formats

Created new fields such as week number, day of week, etc.


# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
* Analyzed trends in call volume, CSAT (Customer Satisfaction), response time, and handling time

* Examined weekly changes in customer behavior

* Assessed SLA performance and sentiment distribution

* Segmented data by channel, region, and reason of calls

# 3. Dashboard Creation (Excel)
   
Developed three interactive dashboards using Excel:

* Overview Dashboard â€“ general KPIs like number of calls, customers, call duration, etc.

* Customer Experience Dashboard â€“ KPIs like Avg calls/day , SLA Compliance rate , Call peak day.

* Channel & Regional Insights Dashboard â€“ breakdown by communication channels and regional trends.

 # Importance of Selected KPIs: 
 
 *  1. Average CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score) : 
This is one of the most critical KPIs for measuring the overall customer experience. It reflects how satisfied customers are with the service they received. Monitoring CSAT helps identify pain points in the customer journey and assess the quality of support provided. A consistently low CSAT indicates the need for service improvement, while an increasing CSAT shows that customer needs are being effectively met.

* 2. Average Call Duration:
Tracking the average time spent on calls helps assess the efficiency of call handling. It provides insights into whether agents are taking too long to resolve issues or handling them too quickly without proper attention. However, in this project, it was found that longer call duration does not necessarily lead to higher satisfaction, which emphasizes focusing on call quality instead of just call length.

* 3. Call Peak Day:
Identifying the day with the highest call volume is essential for resource planning and workforce management. Knowing the peak day helps ensure that sufficient staff and support are available during the busiest periods to maintain service quality and prevent customer dissatisfaction due to long wait times.

* 4. Average Calls per Day:
This KPI provides a baseline to understand daily call center workload. It helps in scheduling, setting service level targets, and monitoring whether call volumes are increasing or decreasing over time. Sudden changes in daily averages can signal emerging customer issues or shifts in customer behavior that need further investigation.

* 5. SLA Compliance Rate:
The SLA (Service Level Agreement) Compliance Rate measures the percentage of calls that were answered or resolved within the agreed-upon time frame. This is a key performance indicator for operational efficiency and responsiveness. A high SLA compliance rate shows that the team is meeting service expectations, while a low rate may indicate process bottlenecks or understaffing.

# ðŸ“Œ Key Findings

* Billing questions accounted for over 70% of negative customer feedback.

* There was a notable increase in call volume during Week 3, requiring attention.

* Handling time had no clear correlation with CSAT, indicating that customers value issue resolution more than call length.

* Some states and cities (e.g., Wyoming, Newport Beach) consistently showed low satisfaction.

* Channels like email and chatbot are underused despite being cost-efficient.

# Recommendations

  * Improve billing issue handling: Focus on training agents and improving billing process clarity.

  * Monitor call spikes: Investigate causes of Week 3 volume surge (promotion, technical issues, etc.).

  *  Optimize call center quality: Since SLA alone doesn't impact CSAT, focus on first-call resolution and agent communication.

  * Address regional dissatisfaction: Dive into underperforming regions to improve local service delivery.

  * Promote digital channels: Encourage usage of email/chatbot for simpler inquiries to reduce call center load.

  
  # ðŸ“ˆ Estimated Business Impact: 
  
    * Potential CSAT Improvement: Estimated increase of 15-20% if billing communication is improved and agent training is enhanced.

   * Call Load Reduction: Shifting simple inquiries to digital channels could reduce call volume by 10-15%, improving response time.

   * Customer Retention: Improved service quality and better first-call resolution may enhance customer retention by 5-10%.
