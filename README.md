📞 Call Center Data Analysis Project
🧭 Objective
This project aims to analyze a month's worth of call center data in order to identify service performance, customer satisfaction trends, and operational bottlenecks. The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to enhance customer experience, reduce dissatisfaction, and improve service level efficiency.

⚙️ Project Steps

1. Data Cleaning & Processing

Converted date/time columns to proper formats

Created new fields such as week number, day of week, etc.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
* Analyzed trends in call volume, CSAT (Customer Satisfaction), response time, and handling time

* Examined weekly changes in customer behavior

* Assessed SLA performance and sentiment distribution

* Segmented data by channel, region, and reason of calls

3. Dashboard Creation (Excel)
   
Developed three interactive dashboards using Excel:

* Overview Dashboard – general KPIs like number of calls, customers, call duration, etc.

Customer Experience Dashboard – KPIs like Avg calls/day , SLA Compliance rate , Call peak day.

Channel & Regional Insights Dashboard – breakdown by communication channels and regional trends.

📌 #Key Findings

* Billing questions accounted for over 70% of negative customer feedback.

* There was a notable increase in call volume during Week 3, requiring attention.

* Handling time had no clear correlation with CSAT, indicating that customers value issue resolution more than call length.

* Some states and cities (e.g., Wyoming, Newport Beach) consistently showed low satisfaction.

* Channels like email and chatbot are underused despite being cost-efficient.

✅ #Recommendations

🔧 Improve billing issue handling: Focus on training agents and improving billing process clarity.

🎯 Monitor call spikes: Investigate causes of Week 3 volume surge (promotion, technical issues, etc.).

🤝 Optimize call center quality: Since SLA alone doesn't impact CSAT, focus on first-call resolution and agent communication.

🌍 Address regional dissatisfaction: Dive into underperforming regions to improve local service delivery.

💬 Promote digital channels: Encourage usage of email/chatbot for simpler inquiries to reduce call center load.
